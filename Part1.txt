1.Explain what is meant by a docker image and container.

A Docker image is an unchangeable file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run.
Due to their read-only quality, these images are sometimes referred to as snapshots. They represent an application and its virtual environment at a specific point in time. This consistency is one of the great features of Docker. It allows developers to test and experiment software in stable, uniform conditions.

A Docker container is a virtualized run-time environment where users can isolate applications from the underlying system. These containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an application quickly and easily.

7.Explain what the -p option in the docker run command in (5) does.

asks Docker to forward traffic incoming on the host’s port 8000, to the container’s port 8080. Containers have their own private set of ports, so if you want to reach one from the network, you have to forward traffic to it in this way. Otherwise, firewall rules will prevent all network traffic from reaching your container, as a default security posture.
